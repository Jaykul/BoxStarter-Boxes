# Quickly set up a new Windows machine the way I like it

The Easy Mode, Windows-only way to run this repo is through [BoxStarter](https://boxstarter.org/). You can point boxstarter at the Install.ps1 file in this repo and it will install everything -- or you can point it at the "Install.ps1" file in any of the numbered folders to install that folder and everything lower that that.

In other words, if you use Edge to open [https://boxstarter.org/package/url?https://github.com/Jaykul/BoxStarter-Boxes/raw/main/Install.ps1](https://boxstarter.org/package/url?https://github.com/Jaykul/BoxStarter-Boxes/raw/main/Install.ps1) it will install everything, just the way I like it.

## Not me? Not a problem!

If you don't want my customizations and extras, you could use [https://boxstarter.org/package/url?https://github.com/Jaykul/BoxStarter-Boxes/raw/main/10_DevBox/Install.ps1](https://boxstarter.org/package/url?https://github.com/Jaykul/BoxStarter-Boxes/raw/main/10_DevBox/Install.ps1).

The Hard Mode, Windows way to run this repo is to [download it](https://github.com/Jaykul/BoxStarter-Boxes/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it, and run the `Install.ps1` directly. That will install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and [BoxStarter](https://boxstarter.org/) and then run the rest of the `Install.ps1` files in this repo.
